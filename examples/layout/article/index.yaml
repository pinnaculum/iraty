    Something has always existed. According to physics, there can never
    be true physical nothingness—though there can be times when existence
    resembles nothing, such as a vacuum (the state of minimum possible
    energy) (Phys.org).  Creating a space where there are no quantum
    fluctuations requires an enormous amount of energy, and there would
    be a remnant of that energy in that space afterwards if the fluctuations
    were flushed out, plus an unstable environment (1veritasium). Even on
    computers, deleted data is not actually tossed away, by rather written
    over. The fact that there can never be nothingness means the
    universe, and anything possibly beyond it, is eternal, as something has
    always been around. Whatever we consider to be before the Big Bang—God,
    the universe in infinitesimal form, or both—one thing is certain: it was
    there.

    In 1986, DC Comics published a four issue mini-series called
    Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. While few would have predicted it prior
    to its publication, this work of Frank Miller was soon regarded as one of
    the touchstones for the medium and, through commercial success and critical
    controversy, almost single-handedly reinvigorated a moribund character. Time
    magazine suggested the portrayal of a ‘semiretired Batman [who] drinks too
    much and is unsure about his crime-fighting abilities’ was an example of
    trying to appeal to ‘today’s sceptical readers’.

    Regardless of the criticism which the series received in some quarters, it
    undoubtedly did appeal to readers and the manner in which its ‘dark’ and
    ‘adult’ approach were progressively taken up by other comics points to the
    ‘scepticism’ of those readers being a widespread condition rather than the
    aberrant property of a cynical minority. The same dark approach lay behind
    the critical and commercial success which Christopher Nolan’s
    The Dark Knight enjoyed at the box office in the summer of 2008.
    Why is this kind of approach so popular? What explains its manifest
    resonance amongst vast swathes of the cinema-going and comic-buying public?
